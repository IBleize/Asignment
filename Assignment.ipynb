    "In this notebook, we will explore various tools and languages used in the field of data science. This course has introduced multiple data science tools, and in this final project, we will demonstrate our understanding and application of these tools using JupyterLite Notebook. The exercises will cover essential aspects of data science, including languages, libraries, and frameworks that are crucial for data analysis and machine learning. Through this project, we aim to consolidate our knowledge and showcase our skills in data science."
